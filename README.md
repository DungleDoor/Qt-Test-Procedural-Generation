# Qt-Test-Procedural-Generation

### Instructions
Just clone the repository and open in qtcreator
it should work, but i used a slightly different version of qt so if it doesn't just make a blank project and copy the code over

### Settings
Noise Percentage - initial percent of cells that are alive (white)
Generations - # of generations rules are applied, set to 0 to see initial noise pattern
The last two define the two rules that are applied to generate map, should be pretty self explanatory, overpopulation is set to 9 because there can never be more than 8 alive neighbors
